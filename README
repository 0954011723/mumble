 A voicechat utility for gamers

  http://mumble.sourcforge.net/


Mumble is a voicechat program for gamers written on top of Qt and Speex.

There are two modules in Mumble; the client (mumble) and the server
(murmur). The client works on Win32 and Linux, while the server should work
on anything QT can be installed on.

Note that when we say Win32, we mean Windows XP or newer.

Running Mumble
==============

After installation, you should have a new Mumble folder in your Start Menu,
from which you can start Mumble. You need a server to connect to, either
create your own or join a friend's.

Note that it's perfectly possible to make the internal state of the audio
preprocessor incosistant so that voice activity and noise filtration doesn't
work. Disconnection and reconnection your microphone will cause this, as
will rubbing it with paper -- anything that causes signals that are way out
of the normal range. If this happens, use Audio|Reset (or the bound
shortcut) to reset it.

Running Murmur
==============

Murmur must be run from the command line, so start a shell (command prompt)
and go to wherever you installed Mumble. Run murmur as

murmur [-supw <password>] [-ini <inifile>]

-supw   Set new password for the user SuperUser, which is hardcoded to
        bypass ACLs. Keep this password safe. Until you set a password,
        the SuperUser is disabled. If you use this option, murmur will
        set the password in the database and then exit.

-ini    Use a inifile other than murmur.ini, use this to run several isntances
        of murmur from the same directory. Make sure each instance is using
        a separate database.

Bandwidth usage
===============

Mumble will use 10-40 kbit/s outgoing, and the same incoming for each user.
So if there are 10 other users on the server with you, your incoming
bandwidth requirement will be 100-400 kbit/s if they all talk at the same time.

Mumble on X11
=============

Unlike Windows, there is no easy way to monitor all key and mouse events
under X11. At the moment, Mumble uses the Xevie extension to accomplish
this, but unfortunately that extension is disabled by default. To enable it
(and push-to-talk), add the following to your xorg.conf:

Section "Extensions"
	Option "XEVIE" "Enable"
EndSection
