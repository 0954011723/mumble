Description: Low latency VoIP client
 Mumble is a low-latency, high quality voice chat program for gaming.
 It features noise supression, automatic gain control and low latency audio
 under both ALSA and OSS.
 Mumble inclues an ingame overlay compatible with most opensource and
 commercial OpenGL applications.
 Mumble is just a client and uses a proprietary protocol. You will need
 a dedicated server to talk to other users. Server functionality is provided
 by the package "murmur".

Description: Low latency VoIP server
 Murmur is the VoIP server component for Mumble.
 Murmur is installed in a systemwide fashion, but can also be run by
 individual users.
 Each murmur process supports multiple virtual servers, each with their
 own userbase and channel list.
 Administration of murmur is done through D-Bus. Example scripts which
 register new users and list connected users through a webpage are
 included.
