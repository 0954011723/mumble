mumble (1.1.3-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Licensing issues worked out, package is now BSD licensed (same as
    source).
  * Fixes a GUI freeze in mumble when moving a player to a parent channel.
  * Mumble-specific changes to Speex are now in upstream Speex, and
    this version includes all changes necessary to mumble to unbundle
    Speex. Once Speex 1.2beta4 or 1.2 final is out, unbundling can be
    completed.
  * Changed to use PulseAudio as default audio device, as it's the
    default in Hardy.
  * Moved the perl cgi scripts for mumble-server into a separate package,
    which means mumble-server doesn't depend on httpd and
    mail-transport-agent (which it didn't, but the cgi scripts didn't
    work without them).
  * Updated packaging to adhere to "Debian Developer's Reference -
    Best Packaging Practices."
