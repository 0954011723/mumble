This package includes a system-wide installation of murmurd. If you want a
personal server running on your own user account, use the murmur-wrapper
script.

If you have apache running, you can access the user list at
http://localhost/cgi-bin/mumble-server/list.cgi
and new users can register themselves at
http://localhost/cgi-bin/mumble-server/register.cgi

For registration to work, you will need to set an email address to use for
registraion emails. To set the address, dpkg-reconfigure mumble-server.

Murmur's root user is called SuperUser. To set the password for superuser, 
simply dpkg-reconfigure mumble-server.
