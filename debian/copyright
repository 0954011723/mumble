Subject: Re: OCB under BSD License?

Hi Thorvald,

Nice to hear from you, and to hear that OCB is in Mumble.

I am in fact planning to greatly broaden the patent grant; I just need to
check with my attorney to see what's the best way to word it. Thanks for the
excellent suggestion to include "all programs whose complete source code is
freely available".  I will make sure to include this setting.  I am actually
looking to go much further.

Anyway, until I get the wording figured out and on the web
for a very general patent grant, please consider this email from me as
explicit permission to include OCB in Mumble and distribute it under under
BSD (as well as GNU GPL) on a royalty-free basis.

Good luck, and thanks for creating your software.

phil
