Binary versions
===============

Binary versions for Win32 of the most recent version of mumble are provided
on sourceforge.net, see http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/

The only legitimate releases of Mumble will be on sourceforge, any other
place offering Mumble is likely to contain trojans or viruses.

Pre-requisites
==============

Mumble and murmur depends on Qt; either the opensource or commercial
versions. Please see http://www.trolltech.com/qt/ for more information. As
we use the Qt build system, it's important that you have a fully functional
Qt installation.

Mumble depends on libspeex. See http://www.speex.org for details. Note that
you need the latest "unstable" version to compile. (Speex generally has high
code quality, the the svn version is probably even more stable than the
released unstable version).

Mumble needs the ASIO SDK to compile ASIO support. If you don't have the SDK,
remove the line that says CONFIG+=asio in mumble.pro

CVS versions of Mumble and Murmur may depend on the Boost C++ library.

You may need to adjust the paths in mumble.pro, murmur.pro and mumble.pri to
reflect where your installed versions of dependant libraries are.

Building Mumble
===============

At the moment Mumble only works on Win32 clients, as it uses DirectSound
for audio input and output. The architecture is flexible enough to easily
accomodate an ALSA version as soon as we get a developer with sufficient
interrest.

To build mumble, type
qmake mumble.pro
make


Building Murmur
===============

Murmur works well on both UNIX and Win32 servers.

To build murmur, type
qmake murmur.pro
make

Note that you need to set up and configure murmur.pl as a CGI on your
webserver for user registration to work.
