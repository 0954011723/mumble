Binary versions
===============

Binary versions for Win32 of the most recent version of mumble are provided
on sourceforge.net, see http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/

The only legitimate releases of Mumble will be on sourceforge, any other
place offering Mumble is likely to contain trojans or viruses.

Pre-requisites
==============

Mumble and murmur depends on Qt version 4.2.0 or above; either the opensource
or commercial versions will do.
Please see http://www.trolltech.com/qt/ for more information. As we use the Qt
build system, it's important that you have a fully functional Qt installation.

The mumble build uses pre-comiled headers. If you use GCC, make sure it's at
least version 3.4.

Mumble needs the Boost C++ library. http://www.boost.org

You may need to adjust the paths in mumble.pro, murmur.pro and mumble.pri to
reflect where your installed versions of dependant libraries are.

Windows pre-requisites
======================

Mumble needs the ASIO SDK to compile ASIO support. If you don't have
the SDK, remove the line that says CONFIG+=asio in mumble.pro

Mumble also needs the DirectX 9.0 SDK, and the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1.

The windows build has only been done with MinGW. If you have success with other
build environments, please let us know.

Detailed build instructions are available at
http://mumble.sourceforge.net/BuildingWindows and it is highly recommended
to follow them to the letter.

Linux pre-requisites
====================

Mumble needs libasound2 (the ALSA developer libraries) as well as the developer
libraries for Xevie.

The Linux version of the client is developed on Ubuntu 6.10. It may work on
other updated distributions. The server should work on any modern UNIX-based
distribution and on Windows.

Building Mumble
===============

To build mumble, type
qmake mumble.pro
lupdate mumble.pro
lrelease mumble.pro
make

You may need to edit mumble.pro to reflect the installation paths you use for
libraries.

Building Murmur
===============

To build murmur, type
qmake murmur.pro
make

To enable user registration, copy murmur.pl to murmur.cgi and put it
somewhere accessible by your webserver. Make sure your webserver is 
configured to execute it as a CGI, and make sure you edit it to reflect
the configuration parameters. Note that the user the CGI will run as needs
write permissions to both the database file and the directory the database
file resides in.
